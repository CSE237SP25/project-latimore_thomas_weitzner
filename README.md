Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
* All code on the development branch works as intended. We have a few pull requests open that might not be merged in by the time of the peer review on some of the issues in "next iteration".
* There are a few test cases that don't seem to be passing (they used to) but the functionality still works when tested manually. Something to look into soon.

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (please provide a script that users can run to launch your program)?

Make sure you are in the root of the repo then run:
chmod +x runBearBanks.sh
./runBearBanks.sh
